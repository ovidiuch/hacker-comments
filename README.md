Hacker Comments
===============

A browser hack to improve navigation for Hacker News ([news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com)) users.

It maps `SHIFT+BACKSPACE` for opening the comments page from any web page that was open (thus redirected) from the Hacker News listing page.

`SHIFT+BACKSPACE` can also be used to go back to the listing page from any HN comments page.
